```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ First request: 201 Created (5000 coins deducted)
- ✅ Second request: 400 Insufficient Balance
- ✅ Total deducted: 5000 (not 10000)

**Validation**:
```sql
SELECT coins FROM users WHERE id = '{user-id}';

## 🌙 Category 11: Dark Mode Regression Tests

### TC-WITHDRAWAL-DM-001: Monetization Dashboard — All Backgrounds in Dark Mode

**Type:** Bug Regression / Manual
**Feature area:** `app/monetization/index.tsx` (MonetizationDashboardScreen + PayoutStatusBadge)
**Priority:** P1

**Preconditions:**
- Device set to dark appearance
- User is a chef with at least one pending or completed withdrawal

**Steps:**
1. Enable dark mode on device
2. Launch app, log in as Chef
3. Navigate to Profile → Monetization (full dashboard)
4. Observe: Available Balance card, Summary card, withdrawal history cards, payout status badge, notes container, failure reason banner (if any)

**Expected result:** Container uses `colors.background` (#0A0A0A). Cards (`availableBalanceCard`, `summaryCard`, `emptyCard`) use `colors.surface` (#1C1C1E). Notes / payout detail containers use `colors.surfaceElevated` (#2C2C2E). All text follows theme tokens. Failure reason banner uses `colors.warning + '25'` tint.
**Actual result (before fix):** `container.backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5'` (grey), all card backgrounds `'#fff'` (white), `notesContainer.backgroundColor: '#f9f9f9'`, `payoutStatusContainer.backgroundColor: '#f0f8ff'`, `failureReasonContainer.backgroundColor: '#fff3cd'` — entire screen appeared white/light grey in dark mode.
**Fix applied:** Converted static `StyleSheet.create` to `makeStyles(colors: any)` factory in `monetization/index.tsx`; added `const styles = useMemo(() => makeStyles(theme.colors), [theme.colors])` and `useMemo` import. `PayoutStatusBadge` already received `styles` as a prop so it automatically benefits from the theme-aware styles.
**Regression test:** `apps/chefooz-app/src/app/monetization/__tests__/monetization.dark-mode.spec.ts`
**Status:** Fixed ✅
